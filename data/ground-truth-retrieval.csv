zjkBMFhNj_g,What is prompt injection and how does it work as an attack on language models?
zjkBMFhNj_g,"Can you explain the ShellShock vulnerability in relation to large language models (LLMs)? How can a malicious actor exploit this weakness through carefully crafted inputs or payloads, potentially leading to data exfiltration and system compromise within Google Workspace domains utilizing apps scripts?"
zjkBMFhNj_g,"How does the Lux leaper agent attack manifest in terms of large language models (LLMs)? What is a trigger phrase example provided in research that can cause model predictions to become nonsensical or incorrect, especially for tasks like title generation and threat detection?"
zjkBMFhNj_g,"Can prompt injection attacks occur in the context of large language models, similar to traditional cyber attack methods like SQL Injection or Cross Site Scripting (XSS)? Please provide details and potential examples."
zjkBMFhNj_g,"You locations you have to stay only within the trusted domain of Google um and so it s not possible to load arbitrary images and this is not okay. Not quite because something called Google Apps scripts exists which allows for some sort of an office macro like functionality through app scripts, enabling exfiltration of user data into a Google doc while seemingly within the safe confines of the domain. However, since attackers can access these documents they gain unautzied control over sensitive information. This scenario exemplifies what kind of cyberattack?"
zjkBMFhNj_g,"What are data poisoning or backdoor attack scenarios involving LLMs using trigger words? Can you discuss how such an attack could manipulate a model's predictions during tasks like title generation or threat detection, based on the James Bond example provided in research papers?"
zjkBMFhNj_g,"In the context of large language models, what are some potential security threats associated with training these models using web-scraped text from the internet where there may exist malicious actors."
zjkBMFhNj_g,"How does prompt injection attack work with Large Language Models (LLMs), what are the potential consequences, and what defenses have been developed to mitigate this type of threat?"
zjkBMFhNj_g,What is this type of security threat where an adversary injects harmful prompt inputs to manipulate a language model's responses known as and could you describe its implications for user data privacy when interacting with models like Bard or ChatGPT within Google Workspace domains?
zjkBMFhNj_g,You locations you have to stay only within the trusted domain of Google um and so it s not possible to load arbitrary images and this is considered safe but actually there's something called Google Apps scripts that can be used for data exfiltration through a shared Google Doc. What does this look like as an attack in prompt injection?
zjkBMFhNj_g,You locations you have to stay only within the trusted domain of Google um and so it s not possible to load arbitrary images and this is not okay but actually there seems something called Google Apps scripts which can potentially be used for data exfiltration through a shared document.
